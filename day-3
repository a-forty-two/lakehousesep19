2 architecture styles:

Lambda:
	2 separate architectures: Batch, Stream 
			Data Lake-> Data Factory-> Synapse
			
			Sensor-> IoT Hub-> Stream Analytics-> Synapse

Kappa:
			Spark Structured Streaming

	unified architecture for batch and stream 
			Delta Lake- type of Kappa Architecture 
			MPP - massive parallel processing 
					- streaming API (Synapse/SQL DW/Snowflake) 

Open source/Azure:
	-> Delta -> stream/batch-> batch process
				-> Transformations and Actions
Google/Open Source:
	-> Apache Beam-> stream/batch-> stream process
				-> pDATA and pTransform 

Both-> DAG is formed 

Graph Theory-> Cyclic and Acyclic 
									-> directed or undirected
